# Onshape-Boat-Tutorial
Hey there! This repository contains the source code for an instruction set as part of an assignment for my upper division writing class. The document was crafted using Typst and a variety of tools to produce the final PDF!

## Tools Used
- [VS Code + Tinymist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist): For writing and rendering Typst code locally in real-time
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/): To annotate and draw on screenshots
- [SVG Gobble](https://github.com/rossmoody/svg-gobbler): For extracting scalable SVGs from Onshape UI
- [`oasis-align`](https://github.com/jdpieck/oasis-align): A custom Typst package for precise content alignment

<!--
# Todo
- [x] Add arrows
- [x] Fix first image numbering
- [x] Change dim image to include setting dim
- [x] remove headers from figure 7 and 8
- [x] move sketch done to figure 9

## If there is time
- [x] Clean up images 
- [x] Add button icons (probably needs a package)
- [ ] Add lines between figures aligned together
