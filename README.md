# Onshape-Boat-Tutorial
Hey there, and welcome to the my Onshape-Boat-Tutorial repository! This project contains the source code for an instruction set I created as part of an assignment for my upper division writing class. The document serves a second purpose: a guide to help new [Cyclone RoboSub](https://cyclone-robosub.github.io/) members get familiar with [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/), a cloud-based CAD platform.

I typeset this document using a markup language called [Typst](https://typst.app/) with assistance from a variety of tools listed below. Creating this document from scratch was an incredibly enjoyable process, and I highly recommend Typst for any professional documentation needs. To offer insight into my work-process, I’ve left commented sections in the source code.

## Tools Used
- [VS Code + Tinymist](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist) - For writing and rendering Typst code locally in real-time
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) - To annotate and draw on screenshots
- [SVG Gobble](https://github.com/rossmoody/svg-gobbler) - For extracting scalable SVGs from Onshape user interface
- [`oasis-align`](https://github.com/jdpieck/oasis-align) - A custom Typst package I developed for precise content alignment

## Why Typst
I am extraordinarily proud of the final product, and much of my success is in part thanks to the amazing toolset that I had at my disposal--especially Typst. I believe that this document showcases Typst's potential for creating polished, professional documentation.

One of Typst’s standout features is its ability to separate style from content. This allows me to focus on writing without being distracted by formatting concerns. When I’m ready, I can seamlessly transition into editing the document’s layout and style.

Typst’s dynamic nature particularly shines in layout design. Its adaptive layout functions ensure that changes to content have minimal impact on the overall structure. For example, my oasis-align package dynamically adjusts figure sizes based on their context, enabling a smooth and efficient workflow.

Thank you for exploring this repository! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I hope it inspires you to try Typst and explore its capabilities for your own projects!

<!--
# Todo
- [x] Add arrows
- [x] Fix first image numbering
- [x] Change dim image to include setting dim
- [x] remove headers from figure 7 and 8
- [x] move sketch done to figure 9

## If there is time
- [x] Clean up images 
- [x] Add button icons (probably needs a package)
- [ ] Add lines between figures aligned together
