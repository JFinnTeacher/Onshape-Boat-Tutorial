= Introduction


Ahoy there, and welcome to Cyclone RobSub! We are thrilled to have you with us!

As part of our training regimen, you and your team will be asked to design, model, assemble, wire, and program a small model boat. This document covers the modeling portion of your training. No prior experience in any CAD software is required to follow along.

In this document, you will be guided through the process of creating a sample boat that you are encouraged to build upon for your teams design. The primary goal of this document is to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of CAD design in OnShape.
